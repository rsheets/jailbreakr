jailbreakr: Get out of Excel, free

One out of every ten people on the planet uses a spreadsheet and about
half of those use formulas: "Let's not kid ourselves: the most widely
used piece of software for statistics is Excel." (Ripley, 2002) Those of
us who script analyses are in the distinct minority!

There are several effective packages for importing spreadsheet data into
R. But, broadly speaking, they prioritize access to [a] data and [b]
data that lives in a neat rectangle. In our collaborative analytical
work, we battle spreadsheets created by people who did not get this
memo. We see messy sheets, with multiple data regions sprinkled around,
mixed with computed results and figures. Data regions can be a blend of
actual data and, e.g., derived columns that are computed from other
columns.

We will present our work on extracting tricky data and formula logic out
of spreadsheets. To what extent can data tables be automatically
identified and extracted? Can we identify columns that are derived from
others in a wholesale fashion and translate that into something useful
on the R side? The goal is to create a more porous border between R and
spreadsheets. Target audiences include novices transitioning from
spreadsheets to R and experienced useRs who are dealing with challenging
sheets.
